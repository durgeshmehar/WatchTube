This file is the main entry point of the application. It imports the BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components from react-router-dom. It also imports the Box component from @mui/material. The Box component is used to create a div with a black background.

The App component renders the Navbar component and the Routes component. The Routes component is used to define the routes for the application. The routes are:

* /: This route renders the Feed component.
* /video/:id: This route renders the VideoDetail component.
* /channel/:id: This route renders the ChannelDetail component.
* /search/:searchTerm: This route renders the SearchFeed component.

The App component is exported so that it can be used in other parts of the application.
